**Components used**

Adafruit Feather RP2040

Airlift wifi module

APDS 9960 sensor

ST7735R

Adafruit STEMMA Speaker Relay

Cirtuit Playground Express

Several cables

Also, we connected the speaker and the Circuit Playground Express using a relay with this system above like this

                        Circuit Playground with Adafruit Speaker

Because the speaker is controlled by Circuit Playground express, in this way we can use Microcontroller to control the speaker.

**Description of your RP2040 dev environment:  
**We use Circuit Python language and Mu editor to finish our code. It is easier to make some functions code working together on the same microcontroller.
